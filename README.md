ATLAS - Jack Richard's personal assistant

Instructions for Reinforcement Learning Graders:

Because my project does not fit in a 5 page jupyter notebook, please refer to the Atlas.py file and moviebloc.py files, specifically.

The next goal for this is to detach from the A.L.I.C.E architecture and train Atlas for more fluid interactions.

Another research focus will be towards beneficial user simulation.
